        <p>Our school is a clear departure from the picture of a rigid and authoritarian structure. The human like compassion, cooperation, friendliness, smile, laughter, belongingness and caring for fellow beings are all components of the teaching- learning system. Apart from scholastics, co-curricular and co-scholastic activities are also given equal importance. Effective measures are also taken to ensure perfections in the character moulding and cultural development. The basic factors pertaining to communal harmony, national integration, patriotism etc. are also taught to students.
            <br><br>
            What makes us unique and exclusive is that we constantly strive to bring out the ability inherent in every child, nurture it through proper guidance and motivation to help it attain the peak of glory..

I would also like to thank the entire TIG group and SIT Siliguri for bringing a company of ThoughtWorks' stature in o our campus and providing me with the opportunity to rub shoulders with the very best in the industry. I have also been lucky enough to go back to the campus that I was hired from, twice, to recruit future ThoughtWorkers who will shape our organisation's tomorrow. I am thankful to ThoughtWorks and TIG group for the same and would like to express my desire to continue visiting the campus since it keeps giving us some of the brightest minds that we boast about.<br>

          <p class="p_modal">Altimetrik India Pvt Ltd SIT <br><br>Time and Tide waits for none they say, but the same can surely be tamed. That's what I learned and slowly realized all through out my college life. Just another random looking engineering institute was indeed the one with a bit of difference. While in the lap of the Queen of Hills, The Siliguri Institute of Technology, or let me proudly ca all it - 'My Alma Mater', nurtured my inner self and made me ready for the big bad world and most importantly the industry where one faces surprising harsh realities of a corporate life. The Faculty is ever helpful and niche in their areas, they develop your technical skills in a manner that certainly is a demand in the industry currently, a demand which is not sufficiently fulfilled, especially in the Indian IT and other technical sectors. No wonder, the students have proven themselves nationally and internationally. When I wrote my first 'Hello World' program in college I had no idea that one day my codes will indeed literally be greeting the World a big Hello, and when I feel my chest puffed today I definitely end up giving my college the absolute credit which shaped every student into smartest innovators and wildest corporate bulls ready to fight the tuff Bhallal Devas and definitely beating him! LOL!! Enough said, all I have to conclude is apart from the buildings and Labs and facilities, the college had skills and values to offer, the buildings might fall and perish, but the values and skills will remain and help you realize your destination while you are finding paths in your journey. Hope you are smiling enough while you read my nostalgia, wish you every Luck and Success!.<br>
